It does:
1) get raw data from Peipoch's repository
2) round up decimals of all continuous variables
3)
```{r}
library(readr);library(knitr)
raw_data = read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mpstroud/LTREB_Valett/main/UCFRmtl1.csv")

#round up conc and MDL at 2 decimal points
raw_data$conc = round(raw_data$conc,2) ; raw_data$MDL = round(raw_data$MDL,2)

#transpose by type and metal
library(reshape2) ; library(tidyr) ; library(dplyr)

t_data_1 = spread(raw_data, type, conc)
t_data_filtered = spread(t_data_1, metal, "F") ; t_data_unfiltered = spread(t_data_1, metal, "W")
t_data_filtered$W = NULL ; t_data_unfiltered$F = NULL #remove old type variable

colnames(t_data_filtered)[9:21] <- paste("Diss", colnames(t_data_filtered)[9:21], sep = "_")
colnames(t_data_unfiltered)[9:21] <- paste("Tot", colnames(t_data_unfiltered)[9:21], sep = "_")

final = inner_join(t_data_filtered,t_data_unfiltered, by = "sampleno") # merge the two datasets
lm(final$day.x ~ final$day.y) #correlation between days in dissolved and total subdatasets is perfect what suggest the merge was done well. Just need now to polish and remove unnecessary columns

final[,22:28] = NULL
colnames(final) = sub(".x", "", colnames(final)) #only problem is that each value of concentration takes a row, need to merge rows by samplno
final2 = final %>%
    group_by(sampleno) %>%
    summarize_all(mean, na.rm = TRUE)
#works but I lose all factor columns due to skipping mean function for characters ones. I'll patch it up below, probably a better way to do this
final3 = final %>%
    arrange(Obs) 

final_temp = left_join(final2,final3,by = "sampleno")

merge(lookup, largetable, by = 'HouseType'))

final2$month <- with(final2,HouseTypeNo[match(largetable$HouseType,HouseType)])




summarize_if(~!is.factor(.), mean, na.rm = TRUE)


write.csv(final2, "~/Desktop/horiz_final_LTEB.csv")
```
